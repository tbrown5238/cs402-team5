# rough sketch
This is the first attempt at a bare-bones "simulator".
It is written in Python, intended to communicate with separate "device" applications via sockett.
This was just a quick sketch, using a lot of what I had done for a previous project.
The goal for this first attempt is to get "devices" communicating with each other, and a "simulator" recording all that info.
